When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      You would want to use a remote repository if you would like to collaborate with others on a project you may be working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      Pulling changes manually is more convenient because one decides when to pull the changes instead of an automatic pull where the code being pulled to the local repository may have a bug that would crash the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
      A fork is a clone within GitHub. Clones are copies of a repository in a different location. Branches are commits that split into two to allow experimentation on code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
      One would be able to analyze the most recent changes offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
      I would use a Google Drive shared folder. This would be harder because as multiple people are working on the code, arranging merges may become more difficult. However, the learning curve would be small.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
      One would want to make changes in a separate branch when trying to implement a few feature without interfering with a working program. This also allows for experimental code to take place without breaking the working code.
